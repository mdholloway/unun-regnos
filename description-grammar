Unstructured notes on the grammatical typology of this language.

Quick description: 

Unun Regnos is an ergative-absolutive, head-initial language that is notable for its obligatory incorporation of object nouns, and its usage of nominal classifiers for morphosyntactic agreement, which is used in typologically rare object marking on ergative subjects. Verbal morphology is complex and subsumes the functions of adjectives and adpositions in other languages. There are a number of nominal clitics/morphemes that express speaker attitudes towards the noun -- i.e. honorifics, pejoratives, etc -- and can also convey tense, aspect and modality.

morphosyntax

	head first
		head-modifier word order
	
	word order
		Canonical word order is (VO)S : objects are always incorporated into the verb so always form a word/constiuent.

	morphosyntatic alignment
		This language is ergative-absolutive aligned. Ergative nouns are marked; absolutive ones are not.
	
	POS
		nouns, verbs
		no adjectives: are all stative verbs
		no prepositions: verbal affixes and classifier modification system can handle this
		probably lots of discourse particle things

	agreement
		This language is unusual in having object agreement on the ergative subject: a classifier matching the (incorporated object) is affixed to the ergative subject. Functionally we can think of this language as marking all ergative subjects as doing something to a type of thing.

		(ergative subjects) agents: ergative-small VP (non-finite conjunct)
			ex.
				girl-ERG-food ERG-be.beautiful apple-eat
				`The beautiful girl eats an apple.`
		
		subjects: classifier-small VP (non-finite conjunct)
			ex.
				girl person-be.beautiful laugh
				`the beautiful girl laughs`

		objects: classifier-small VP (non-finite conjunct)
			ex.
				girl-ERG-food apple-eat food-be.freshly.picked
				`the girl eats the freshly picked apple.`

	adpositions
		This language probably does not contain adpositions due to objects being incorporated. As a result, adpositional information is conveyed via verbal modification. Intransitive verbs turn into transitive verbs, and trigger ergativity.

		ex.
			girl-ERG-manmade.structure bridge-sit-under
			`the girl sits under the bridge`

			girl-ERG-manmade.structure bridge-sit-on
			`the girl sits on the bridge`

		When modifying objects of transitive verbs with adpositional arguments, classifier-based modification is used in addition to the derivational verbal affixes.

		ex.
			girl-ERG-food apple-eat-under food-bridge
			`The girl eats an apple under the bridge.`

	persons
		1, 2, 3, ...

		1st and 2nd person affixes attach to general classifier for general use.
		1st and 2nd person affixes can attach to subject nouns to further modify.
		1st and 2nd person affixes replace incorporated objects when they are objects

		ex.
			1-general laugh
			`I laugh.`

			1-girl person-be.beautiful laugh
			`I, a beautiful girl, laugh`

			girl-ERG-person 1-love
			`The girl loves me`

			1-girl-ERG-animal dog-love
			`I, a girl, love dogs.`

	tense-modality
		There is no obligatory tense marking in this language. Time reference can be expressed via temporal particles (like in Chinese).
		There is also morphological marking on nouns -- honorifics, perjoratives, etc -- that can roundabout express time reference: one such marking expresses something like `the N I hope exists`, which can be translated either as the future for a specific reference, or tenseless for a specific reference. Below I'll just use HOPE to mark this affix.

		ex.
			HOPE=girl-ERG-person 1-love
			`I hope a girl loves me.` [non-specific reference]

			HOPE=Mary-ERG-person 1-love
			`(I hope) Mary will love me.`	[specific reference gives future time reference interpretation, as it implies change of state for Mary. lit. `The Mary I hope exists loves me.`]

			Mary-ERG-person HOPE=1-love
			`Mary will love (the new) me.`	[like above, except HOPE modifying 1 means something like "the me I hope to be", implying future time reference]

	number system
		no number system (no singular/plural/etc)
		plurality can still be expressed via modification
	
	numeral system
		base 10
		modification
			uses classifier-small VP to modify nouns
			ex.
				apple fruit-be.5
				`5 apples`
	

	noun classes
		This language uses a number of noun classifiers.

		1:1 correlation? can nouns take different classifiers?
			probably to emphasize different aspects of the noun

			ex.
				girl-ERG-liquid maple.tree-harvest
				`The girl harvested maple syrup.`

				girl-ERG-tool maple.tree-harvest
				`The girl harvested maple lumber.`

	demonstratives
		Particular nominal clitics in this language are used as demonstratives. One clitic (abbreviated here as PROX.DEM) may translate to 'the N close to me', which is translates to Eng. "this". Unlike other modifiers, which use classifier modification as separate units, these nominal clitics attach directly to the VO stem.

			ex.
				PROX.DEM=girl-ERG-person 1-love
				`This girl loves me.`

				1-general-ERG-person PROX.DEM=girl-love
				`I love this girl.`

		When used in combination with person affixes, there is a meaning of metaphorical distance.

			ex.
				PROX.DEM=2-girl-ERG-person 1-visit
				`You, a girl who is dear to me, visit me.`


	adverbial modification
		There are no adverbs in this language. Adverbial modification is done by way of verbal affixes that translate "did V in such a way that" (abbreviated ADV) followed by a nominal modification with a classifier.

			ex.
				girl sing-ADV person-be.loud
				`The girl sings loudly.` lit. `The girl sings in such a way that the girl is loud.`

				girl sing-ADV work.of.art-be.beautiful
				`The girl sings beautifully.`
				`The girl sings a beautiful song.`	lit. `The girl sings in such a way that the song is beautiful.`

				girl sing-ADV work.of.art-be.beautiful person-be.unskilled
				`The girls sings a beautiful song poorly.`	lit. `The girl sings in such a way that the song is beautiful and the girl is unskilled.`

		Note in the above examples that the classifier-modification does not refer to any NP present in the sentence itself, but the implied "song" noun. We can tell that this NP is not truly present in the clause by the lack of ergativity marking.
	

	existentials/possessives
		Existentials are formed using an existential verb.

			ex.
				city exist-ADV place-Pai-be.called
				`There is a city called Pai.`	lit. `A city exists in such a way that the city is called Pai.`

		The transitive form of the verb, which triggers ergativity, is used to express posession.

			ex.
				dog-ERG-person 1-exist-ADV animal-Behemoth-be.called
				`I have a dog named Behemoth`

			ex.
				dog animal-1-exist be.cute  	(hmmm, what to do with ergativity here when they're in relativized modifiers)
				`My dog is cute.`
