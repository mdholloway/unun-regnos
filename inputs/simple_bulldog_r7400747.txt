The bulldog, known as the British Bulldog or English Bulldog, is a medium-size breed of dog from England.

Bulldogs are medium in size, and they are wide and compact with large, thick heads. Their muzzle (nose and mouth) is short, like a pug's. They have stocky legs at each corner of their muscular body, so when they walk, they take short steps and swing their body from side to side.

Their fur comes in many colors, including light brown, white, black or mixed (brindle). Black is not a desired color at dog shows, but black bulldogs can compete. The bulldog is recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).

Bulldogs are good family pets. They are also brave and are good guard dogs. Bulldogs need a lot of human attention to be happy. They do not need much exercise or grooming except for the face, which should be wiped daily in the face folds with a damp cloth. They weigh 53–55 pounds (24–25 kg). They are 12–16 inches (30–41 cm) tall at the shoulders.

The bulldog was originally bred to fight bulls during the 1600s. The dog's mouth is made to bite a bull's nose and not let go.
